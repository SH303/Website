	<h1>Entry 1:</h1>
	<p class="blog-paragraph">For the first few days of the assignment I looked at the assignment brief and got visual studio code working as well as creating a github account to make a repository to commit to. I then worked on the design of the website. I must admit while it may of taken a while to do, this was crucial as this would determine what the website was going to look like throughout most of the pages. I also worked on the index (home) and portfolio page after I had finished designing the pages. I moved onto putting actual content into the website.</p>

	<h1>Entry 2:</h1>
	<p class="blog-paragraph">After the design, index and portfolio page was done I decided to move onto the contact and blog page. The contact page was the page that I had spent on the most out of all of the pages in terms of layout and design that had been done thus far. The blog page however was more simpler to do but was content heavy as I had to write out my progress throughout the assignment which I am doing now.</p>

	<h1>Entry 3:</h1>
	<p class="blog-paragraph">The final things I had done before wrapping up my assignment and submitting it was, doing the site report which was more content heavy than this blog and doing the video demonstration of my website. My next step after this was to make the github repository public and upload the website to github pages so it could be viewed.</p>
