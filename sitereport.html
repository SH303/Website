	<h1 class="sitereportheading1">(15/04/22) Experience Of Learning The Basics Of Web Development, Coding, Design And Debugging Process:</h1>
	<p class="sitereportparagraph1">My experience of learning web development as whole has been great the basics of web development to me were simple enough from the way HTML and CSS is structured and to how it is used this makes this part an up for me. The design of a website however takes more time which is a downside, as you really must think how you want the website to look like. This could take a while to do and personally for my case in this assignment it took me a while to get the design how I wanted it to look. I had to code to make the design then I had to debug by opening the files and looking what changes when I add or remove features.</p>
	<h1 class="sitereportheading2">(15/04/22) Reflective Discussion Of My Module Experience:</h1>
	<p class="sitereportparagraph2">Moving onto reflecting on my module experience, I’ve found the module very beneficial for me as I before taking this module, I didn’t have much experience in web development. But now after taking the module I have a lot more experience at my disposable which could be of use in the future if I ever decide to get a job in the web development. The lecturer is extremely helpful if you have any questions or get stuck, he will do his best to assist you which is always great. The NILE website has been of good use to me throughout this module as it contains all the resources for the module that I have needed such as lecture PowerPoints, activities etc. This is also extremely beneficial to have as you can study at home. Overall, I have really enjoyed the module thus far and it has been superb.</p>
	<h1 class="sitereportheading3">(15/04/22) Design Decisions:</h1>
	<p class="sitereportparagraph3">Whilst developing my website over the term I had to really consider the design. For the background I wanted to be unique I didn’t want to just use colours that’s why I chose to use a GIF for the background as it is moving and repeated. I also used Tahoma font instead of the default font as I didn’t want the website to look too generic. For the colours I didn’t go too overboard and used basic colours, but I made my contact form a dark theme as it flows with the GIF in the background, I mostly used normal colour names but for the form I used hex as it was from a lecture slide and activity.</p>
	<h1 class="sitereportheading4">(15/04/22) Changes:</h1>
	<p class="sitereportparagraph4">I didn’t change much apart from one thing which was where grid was placed in my CSS stylesheets. First, I had it in body then changed it so I could have different grid layouts for different pages, so I made div classes for this in each HTML file and designed it in CSS. This change was done on 12/04/22.</p>
